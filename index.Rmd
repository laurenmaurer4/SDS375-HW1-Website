I am a junior at the University of Texas studying Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Analytics and Business of Sports. In my free time I like hiking, playing sports with my friends and baking.

A few of my favorite shows are:
<ul>
  <li>New Girl</li>
  <li>White Collar</li>
  <li>Psych</li>
  <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
</ul>
