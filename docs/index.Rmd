I am a junior at the University of Texas getting my undergraduate degree in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Analytics and Business of Sports. In the future I would like to work for a sports team doing analytics. In my free time I like hiking, playing sports with my friends and baking.

A few of my favorite National Parks are:
<ul>
  <li>Yosemite</li>
  <li>Glacier</li>
  <li>Grand Tetons</li>
  <li>Rocky Mountain</li>
</ul>
